# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the current PDF template engine with the proven `grid_perfect_generator.py` implementation as the universal default PDF generation system. The current PDF engine has issues with layout, white blocks, and inconsistent formatting, while the grid perfect generator provides flawless table-based layouts with perfect symmetry and no white blocks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the current PDF template engine with the grid perfect generator, so that all PDF generation uses the proven, working implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates any PDF THEN it SHALL use the grid perfect generator implementation
2. WHEN the system generates GST invoices THEN it SHALL use the grid-based GST layout from the perfect generator
3. WHEN the system generates VAT invoices THEN it SHALL use the grid-based VAT layout from the perfect generator
4. WHEN the system generates cash invoices THEN it SHALL use the grid-based cash layout from the perfect generator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing PDF generation calls to seamlessly work with the new engine, so that no functionality is broken during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code calls `PDFTemplateEngine.generate_invoice_pdf()` THEN it SHALL work without modification
2. WHEN the export manager generates PDFs THEN it SHALL use the new grid-based implementation
3. WHEN the diagnostic controller tests PDF generation THEN it SHALL use the new implementation
4. WHEN the PDF exporter service generates PDFs THEN it SHALL use the new implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all generated PDFs to have perfect formatting with no white blocks or layout issues, so that invoices look professional and print correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any PDF is generated THEN it SHALL have no white blocks or gaps
2. WHEN any PDF is generated THEN it SHALL have perfect table alignment and symmetry
3. WHEN any PDF is generated THEN it SHALL use proper fonts and spacing
4. WHEN any PDF is generated THEN it SHALL maintain the existing visual branding and colors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the old PDF engine code to be cleanly removed, so that there's no confusion about which implementation to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the replacement is complete THEN the old PDF template engine SHALL be archived
2. WHEN the replacement is complete THEN all imports SHALL point to the new implementation
3. WHEN the replacement is complete THEN no duplicate or conflicting PDF generation code SHALL exist
4. WHEN the replacement is complete THEN all tests SHALL pass with the new implementation
