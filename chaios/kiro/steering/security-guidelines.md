# Security Guidelines for ChaiOS

## Data Protection Standards
- Encrypt all sensitive data in local storage using Hive encryption
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Implement proper data validation at all entry points
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for all API calls
- Never store sensitive information in plain text
- Implement proper data retention and deletion policies
- Use secure random number generation for sensitive operations

## Access Control Implementation
- Implement robust license validation with server verification
- Use secure session management with appropriate timeouts
- Validate user permissions for all sensitive operations
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Log all security-related events for audit purposes
- Use principle of least privilege for data access
- Implement proper logout and session cleanup

## Code Security Practices
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or sensitive configuration
- Use environment-specific configurations for different deployment stages
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive system information
- Conduct regular security audits of all dependencies
- Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding
- Use secure defaults for all configuration options

## Network Security
- Implement certificate pinning for API communications
- Use proper request signing and validation mechanisms
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use secure headers and proper CORS configuration
- Validate all server responses before processing
- Implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms
- Log all network security events for monitoring
