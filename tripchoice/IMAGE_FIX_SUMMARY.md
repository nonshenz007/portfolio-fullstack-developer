# 🖼️ Travel Destination Images - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
- All travel destination images were showing as blank with question marks
- The application was using Unsplash URLs which were not loading properly
- No local HD 4K images were available for destinations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created HD 4K Image Structure
Created a comprehensive image directory structure with placeholder files for all destinations:

```
images/
├── hero-background-4k.jpg          # Main hero background
├── explore-hero-4k.jpg             # Explore page hero
└── destinations/
    ├── kashmir-valley-4k.jpg       # Kashmir: Snow-capped mountains, Dal Lake, houseboats
    ├── goa-beaches-4k.jpg          # Goa: Golden sand, palm trees, sunset
    ├── dubai-skyline-4k.jpg        # Dubai: Burj Khalifa, Marina, night lights
    ├── thailand-islands-4k.jpg     # Thailand: Turquoise water, longtail boats
    ├── singapore-marina-4k.jpg     # Singapore: Marina Bay Sands, Supertree Grove
    ├── kerala-backwaters-4k.jpg    # Kerala: Traditional houseboat, waterways
    ├── shimla-mountains-4k.jpg     # Shimla: Himalayan peaks, pine forests
    └── vietnam-hoi-an-4k.jpg       # Vietnam: Ancient town, colorful lanterns
```
