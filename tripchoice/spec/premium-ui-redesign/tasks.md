## Project Notes

**Team Size Considerations:**
- For teams of 2-3 developers: Consider splitting Sprints 2 and 3 into sub-sprints
- For larger teams: Parallel work on design tokens + header can accelerate Sprint 2

**QA Integration Strategy:**
- QA involvement from Sprint 1 to prevent bug accumulation
- Sprint-by-sprint validation checkpoints
- Design review gates at end of Sprints 2 & 3

**Future Backlog Items:**
- **Package Detail Page Redesign:** Apply premium design system to individual package pages
- **Mobile App Alignment:** Extend design system to mobile applications
- **Advanced Personalization:** Enhanced user preference integration
- **Performance Monitoring Dashboard:** Real-time Core Web Vitals tracking

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Background image sourcing may require additional design time
- Performance optimization may reveal need for architecture changes
- Accessibility compliance may require component redesigns
