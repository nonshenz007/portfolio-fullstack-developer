# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive backend processing pipeline that connects the existing UI components with actual document validation functionality. The system needs to process uploaded photos through various validation stages including face detection, ICAO compliance checking, format validation, and automated fixing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload photos through the UI and have them processed through a complete validation pipeline, so that I can get accurate compliance results and automated fixes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Import Files" or "Import Folder" THEN the system SHALL load images into the processing queue
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL display them in the preview area with basic metadata
3. WHEN a user selects an image THEN the system SHALL show validation status and results
4. IF an image is selected THEN the system SHALL display detailed validation information in the preview panel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to process individual or multiple photos for validation, so that I can identify compliance issues and get detailed feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Process All" THEN the system SHALL validate all queued images through the complete pipeline
2. WHEN processing individual images THEN the system SHALL run face detection, format validation, and ICAO compliance checks
3. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL update the UI with pass/fail status and detailed results
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggested fixes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want automated fixing capabilities for common photo issues, so that I can quickly resolve compliance problems without manual editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Auto Fix" THEN the system SHALL attempt to automatically correct detected issues
2. WHEN auto-fixing is applied THEN the system SHALL create corrected versions while preserving originals
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL re-validate the corrected images
4. IF auto-fix succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the preview with the corrected image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback during processing, so that I can monitor progress and understand what's happening with my photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for each validation stage
2. WHEN processing individual stages THEN the system SHALL update status messages in real-time
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable guidance
4. IF processing is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow users to resume or restart validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle different photo formats and validation rules, so that the system can support various document types and compliance standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL detect and support multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
2. WHEN validating photos THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate rules based on detected document type
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed validation reports
4. IF custom rules are configured THEN the system SHALL apply them during validation
