# 🚀 CrystalCore Project Portfolio  

Welcome to my portfolio — a collection of projects I’ve built under **CrystalCore**, focused on cross-platform applications, offline-first systems, and automation tools. My work spans **web, mobile, and desktop**, with projects that integrate **AI, security, and scalable architecture** to solve real-world problems.  

I believe in **building fast, testing often, and refining through iteration**. To accelerate development, I leverage **modern developer environments and intelligent coding assistants** — combining human creativity with AI-powered productivity.
